# Vulkan Game Engine Tutorial Series Project


During this project I will learn how to create a game engine using Vulkan using Brendan Galea's tutorial series. The primary aim is to grasp the core concepts of game engine development and graphics programming with Vulkan. Initially, I'll closely follow the tutorials, and as I gain expertise, I'll introduce custom features.

I will also be reading along the Vulkan Tutorial on the website [vulkan-tutorial.com](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction).
